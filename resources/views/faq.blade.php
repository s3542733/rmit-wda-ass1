        <p>Here you can find the answers to some frequently asked question about the ITS!</p>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p><b>Q: What is the purpose of the ITS</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> The goal is to simplify your user experience by allowing you to
                query for help anytime and anywhere! You won't have to drop by the service
                desk for a while!</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p><b>Q: How does the ITS work?</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> Simply click on the 'Create a new Ticket' link on the nav bar and fill
                in the fields! Hit 'Submit' and our team at ITS will get back to you when we've
                got the solution to your problems!</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p><b>Q: How will I know when my ticket has been seen?</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> No need to worry about being overlooked! When we get to your ticket
                we'll change the status from 'pending' to 'in-progress'! Keep an eye out for the
                change and the comments that we'll post on the ticket!</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p><b>Q: How will I know if my problem has been resolved?</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> When we've confirmed that the problem is fixed we'll
                change the status of your ticket from 'in-progress' to 'resolved'! And that'll
                be the end of that pesky problem!</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p><b>Q: My ticket's status says that it's unresolved? What does that mean?</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> It means that the problem was bigger than we thought! Unfortunately,
                it's so big that we've got to take a break from it before we can get back to you!
                But don't worry, it just means that nothing can happen at the moment. We're still
                thinking up solutions for you!</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p><b>Q: A comment has appeared on my ticket! What does this mean?</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> It means that someone from our team has something to tell you! A comment
                most likely means that some progress has been made and someone from our team wants to
                tell you what's going on! Look forward to more if it hasn't been resolved yet!</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p><b>Q: What is the Staff Only button on the nav bar?</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> The Staff Only button takes staff to a page where they can access, edit and
                remove tickets. It's not for public use, but at the moment, it's still accessible. It's
                best to leave it there if you aren't staff.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p><b>Q: I want to leave a comment on my ticket! How do I do that?</b></p>
            <p><b>A:</b> You can't. It's not possible.</p>
